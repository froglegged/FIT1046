        <p><strong>District: </strong>K'or Autonomous Region</p>
        <p><strong>Area Inspector: </strong>Lev Bukharin</p>
        <p><strong>Case Status: </strong>Closed</p>
        <p><strong>Description: </strong>Directorate personnel were notified about what appeared to be a break-in at the factory district located in the Old Town of K'or. A search revealed the personal items of one Martin Radevic, including a Camcorder, alongside a mobile device at the entrance of Mine #19. As part of Directorate policies, detectives made attempts at bringing in the individual for questioning. Raids at his known workplace and home have revealed nothing; it is as if he had disappeared of the face of the Earth.</p>
        
        <p>While initially thought unrecoverable, digital forensic experts brought in from capital headquarters have managed to recover the information on the Camcorder, which appears to detail Radevic's final hours. Radevic appears lucid but possessed with some unseen purpose driving him forwards. A collection of stills has been collated with transcriptions of Radevic's speech and is available for viewing below. The full uncut version is available exclusively on Directorate+, the Talaran owned streaming platform, with your first 12 months available for only $29.99!</p>

        <p>Can you hear them calling? Those tortured souls? Yearning to be let free? It calls for me I think; to be of something greater. It calls from the old industrial district. Once, these buildings were lively. Great centres of industrial trade and commerce. Traders and merchants from across the continent would come and trade. Those days are long gone now.</p>

        <p>But what to be human is to be cursed with sight. This little light will light the way towards s a l v a t i o n.</p>

        <p>Once, these old mines used to fuel heavy industry, great stacks of smoke, like tendrils of some dark god reaching towards the heavens. Proletarians sent to the early grave to fulfil the aspirations of the moneyed few.</p>

        <p>Once more, they shall prefigure the new world. In time, all shall know the warmth of the Old God. Of our creator.</p>

        <p>Soon however, we will take form, of what we had always meant to be. To turn back from this path of ruin and towards the riders of the night. The harbingers of a new era. To subjugate all. In <strong>HIS</strong> form.</p>

            Digital forensic experts concluded that shortly after this moment Radevic's device was dropped. Audio analysis picked up the sounds of slow footsteps, followed by what appears to be rattling. Recording ceased after another 20 minutes where no other audio or visual cues were able to be picked up. A mine exploratory event was called off as power was unable to be restarted to the mine elevator due to it being disconnected for forty years. These case files can be viewed at the K'or Regional Headquarters of the Directorate of State Security.

            <strong>Area Inspector's Note: </strong>This has been the fifth case under similar circumstances this year. The investigation team camped at the site overnight and what they've said is extremely concerning.

            There are rumours that the buildings may still have occupants, or active security systems, although no evidence of either has been found. Some have insisted, even after detailed psychiatric evaluations, that there are "shadows in the walls".

            The video is deeply concerning, our science team is planning to see if the mining chamber can be accessed with a drill. Recommend additional funding from the Imperial Government.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Director's Note: </strong>What nonsense is this? A provocation by pitiful Ocrainian rabble rousers. Behave yourself Inspector, you're on thin ice. Your job is to keep the rabble in line first of all. And find tougher men, not these children! No more treasury funds will be spent on this wild goose chase. This investigation is henceforth concluded.
